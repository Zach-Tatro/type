Hello there, I'm Zach Tatro. Welcome to my GitHub blog!

I am currently and Master in Applied Statistics student at Colorado State University. This blog is a place for me to host my personal projects so that potential employers can see my demonstrated work.

When I am not in school or working on projects, you'll probably find me golfing.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my blog!
